Alarm Clock
-----------
Did you ever sleep in because you overheard your alarm clock? Or you just switched off
the alarm without getting out of bed just to sleep some more hours? Thingy52 can help. It will
turn off the alarm for you, IF you get up. Either you're...
* ...going to the bathroom to get a shower. Thingy will sense the motion if you take it with you.
* ...open the windows to get some fresh air. Thingy will sense the temparatur and CO2 change in
your room.

If not, Thingy will
* ...keep you awake with sound.
* ...communicate to your smart lights (such as [the YeeLight](https://yeelight.com/en_US/product/wifi-led-c))

Sensor Network
--------------
Using multiple sensors it will become cumbersome to read the data of each sensor individually. Given 
that at least two sensors are usually in close proximity, we can set up a sensor network that passes 
the data to the Thingy connected to the server over multiple hops. The focus would then be to implement 
a network protocol on the Thingy. *This would require the thingy to be programmable, which I don't know if
it's the case.*
